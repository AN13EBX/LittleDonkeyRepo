Will put notes in here asap


Removed some of the completity around upper and lower case l or L and E or e.  Now code forces selections to lower case regardless.

^^^^modified in my version

But what if another character is submitted??!?!!?! error control ???






I think the lotto code is better using a seperate function for the generating of the numbers, this could be expanded so that it take the number ranges from the users choice of game.

^^^^still to be done
